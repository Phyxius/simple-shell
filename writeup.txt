Question 1:
    A shell built-in command is a command that is handled specially by the shell, rather than executing an external program. Examples of common shell built-ins include control flow (if/else/for/etc.) and 'exit'.

Question 2:
    Environment variables are variables that are attached to a process's environment; such variables are inherited by subprocesses and usually used to pass information to them or control how they interact with the surrounding operating system. Some examples (taken from a basic install of Ubuntu 14.04):
    1. $PATH - controls the list of directories that a process will search for (usually via execve or similar) when it attempts to load a new process.
    2. $SHELL - the name of the shell that is controlling the current environment; useful for deciding whether certain non-standard built-ins are available.
    3. $TERM - the type of terminal the program is running under; used to decide how to handle e.g. coloring of text.
    4. $USER - the currently logged in user.
    5. $LANG - the current user's language and text encoding.

Question 3:
    fork()'d processes get copies of all open file descriptors from the parent, so care must be taken to close both the parent's and child's file descriptors as appropriate.
